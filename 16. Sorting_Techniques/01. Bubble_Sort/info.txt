[3,4,2,10,7, 6, 15]

* let say you have and array of  few element you want to swap them using buble sort
* let's recall it, what is bubble sort, have you ever seen, when you throw a stone into water
    it goes to the bed/end of earth and bubble up water drop at that place where you droped that 
    stone. ( create hole over there)

* Another example is: you have a few pieces wood of some different size, one is placed on another, 
    Whenever you will pick up the top one. Remaining wood  will be pushed up and continues. Until the pieces are sorted in order of their sizes.


One element will be compared with the hole, if that that is the most  biggest then they are swapped otherwise not.
