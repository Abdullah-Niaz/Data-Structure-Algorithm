Counter Loop vs Controlled Loop:
    Counter Loop: 
        A counter loop is a type of loop where the number of iterations is predetermined based on a counter variable. It typically uses a counter variable that increments or decrements with each iteration until a specified condition is met.
    Controlled Loop: 
        A controlled loop, on the other hand, is a loop where the execution is controlled by a specific condition or set of conditions. It continues iterating until the condition evaluates to false. Unlike counter loops, controlled loops may not have a fixed number of iterations.

Algorithm vs Program:
    Algorithm: 
        An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions designed to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task. It describes the logic and methodology to be followed to achieve the desired outcome.
    Program: 
        A program is a computer-executable implementation of an algorithm written in a specific programming language. It translates the logical steps outlined in an algorithm into executable code that can be run on a computer.

Algorithm vs Flowchart:
    Algorithm: 
        An algorithm is a textual or logical representation of a sequence of steps or actions required to solve a problem or perform a task. It is typically written using natural language or a structured format that defines the logic and operations to be executed.
    Flowchart: 
        A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm that uses various symbols, shapes, and arrows to depict the flow of control and data within the algorithm. It provides a visual representation of the steps outlined in the algorithm.


Function vs Procedure:
    Function: 
        A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task or computation and may return a value. It can accept input parameters and can be called from different parts of the program to perform its defined operation.
    Procedure: 
        A procedure, also known as a subroutine or method in some programming languages, is a block of code that performs a specific task without returning a value. It may accept input parameters and execute a series of statements or operations to accomplish its task.

Main Algorithm vs Sub-Algorithm:
    Main Algorithm: 
        The main algorithm is the primary or overarching set of instructions that outlines the logical steps to solve a problem or achieve a specific objective. It typically encompasses the entire solution and may include calls to sub-algorithms.
    Sub-Algorithm: 
        A sub-algorithm is a smaller, self-contained set of instructions within a larger algorithm that performs a specific task or subtask. Sub-algorithms are often called by the main algorithm to break down complex problems into more manageable components.


Elementary Data Item vs Group Data Item:
    Elementary Data Item:
        An elementary data item, also known as a primitive data type, is a single, indivisible unit of data that represents a basic value. Examples include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and Boolean values.

    Group Data Item:
        A group data item, also known as a composite or structured data type, is a collection of elementary data items grouped together under a single identifier. Examples include arrays, structures, classes, and records, which allow for the organization and manipulation of multiple related data elements as a single entity.
